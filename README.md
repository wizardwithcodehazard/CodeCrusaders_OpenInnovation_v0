## 💼 Business Model: Sustainable Impact for Global STEM Education
- Wolftor’s mission is to democratize STEM education, and our business model balances accessibility with sustainability to reach millions of students worldwide.
1. **Freemium Access**: Core features—problem-solving and animated videos—are free, ensuring every student, from rural India to global classrooms, can benefit. This drives adoption and aligns with our open-source ethos.
2. **Premium Subscription**: A low-cost plan (priced regionally) unlocks advanced features like personalized learning paths, offline video downloads, and priority processing for complex problems. This targets schools, coaching centers, and dedicated learners.
3. **Institutional Partnerships**: Collaborate with schools, universities, and ed-tech platforms to integrate Wolftor as a white-label solution or supplementary tool, generating B2B revenue through licensing or per-user fees.
4. **API Monetization**: Offer a Wolftor API (built on our AI-powered backend) for ed-tech startups or tutoring apps, charging based on usage tiers to fund platform enhancements.
5. **Crowdsourced Growth**: As an open-source project, Wolftor leverages community contributions to expand subjects and features, reducing development costs. Sponsorships from tech giants or CSR programs can subsidize infrastructure.
6. **Impact & Scale**: Revenue reinvests into adding subjects (physics, chemistry), AI-driven parsing, and multilingual support, targeting underserved regions. Partnerships with NGOs can deploy Wolftor in low-income schools, amplifying social impact.
